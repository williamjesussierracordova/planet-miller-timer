#About This Project
Welcome to the Interstellar Time Visualization project! This web page allows you to see the passage of time on both Earth and the planet Miller from the movie Interstellar since its release date.

#Purpose
Inspired by Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, this project highlights the relativity of time in a captivating and educational way. In the movie, time on Miller's planet passes much more slowly than on Earth due to its proximity to a supermassive black hole. This concept of time dilation is visualized here, showing you exactly how much time has elapsed in both locations since the film's premiere.

#Features
Real-Time Time Tracking: View the time that has passed on Earth and Miller's planet since November 7, 2014, the release date of Interstellar.
Educational Insights: Learn about the concept of time dilation and its implications through a practical example from a popular movie.
Interactive and Engaging: An easy-to-navigate interface that provides a seamless experience for users.
Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: The core technologies for building and designing the web page.
GitHub Pages: Hosting the project to make it accessible to everyone.
Moment.js: A JavaScript library used to manipulate and display the time data accurately.
How It Works
The web page calculates the time passed on both Earth and Miller by applying the time dilation factor as depicted in Interstellar. On Miller's planet, one hour equates to approximately seven years on Earth. By using JavaScript and precise calculations, the page updates the time dynamically, giving users a real-time experience.

#Explore and Enjoy
Dive into the fascinating world of time dilation and see how different the flow of time can be between Earth and Miller's planet. We hope you enjoy this unique visualization and gain a deeper understanding of this intriguing scientific concept.

Feel free to explore the project on GitHub and contribute to its development!
